#
# min_backoff_seconds is the minimum countdown, the countdown of the first retry.
# max_backoff_seconds is the maximum; retries will increase the countdown up to this amount.
# These values are an amount of time, as a number of seconds.
# max_doublings setting lets you set the number of times the countdown doubles.
# After that many retries, the countdown stays constant for each subsequent retry.
